Selenium-Cucumber Automation Framework
This project is a modular and scalable test automation framework built using Selenium, Cucumber, and Java, following best practices like Page Object Model (POM), Maven profiles, and reusable utilities for robust testing.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Java

Selenium WebDriver

Cucumber (BDD)

Log4j 1.2.17 for logging

Maven for build and dependency management

ExtentReports for reporting

JUnit for test execution

WebDriverManager (if used)

ðŸš€ Features Implemented
1. Page Object Model (POM)
Clean separation of locators and actions.

Page classes are reusable and modular.

2. Step Definitions
Mapped directly to feature steps.

Calls common actions and POM methods.

Clean and readable step logic.

3. Common Actions
All browser interactions like click, sendKeys, scroll, dragAndDrop, etc., are abstracted.

Includes wait strategies using WebDriverWait.

iFrame Support: Methods to wait for and switch into iframes before interacting.

Shadow DOM Handling: Utility methods to access and interact with shadow DOM elements using JavaScript.

Alert handling, mouse hover, scrolling, and other utility functions.

Centralized exception handling with logs and fallbacks.

4. Logging (Log4j 1.2.17)
Logs added at key execution points.

Helps in debugging and test tracing.

5. Reporting
Integrated ExtentReports.

Detailed HTML reports for test outcomes with steps, screenshots, and logs.

6. Retry Mechanism
Failed tests are automatically retried based on configurable logic.

7. Environment-Based Execution
Maven profiles allow switching between environments (e.g., dev, qa, staging) without modifying code.

Environment-specific properties are loaded dynamically.

8. Exception Handling
Robust try-catch blocks across utilities to prevent crashes.

Fail-safe methods log errors without halting test suites.

9. Wait Strategies
Explicit Waits added for element visibility, alert presence, iframe load, etc., improving test stability.

##  How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run tests with Maven and specify the environment
mvn clean verify -Pqa
